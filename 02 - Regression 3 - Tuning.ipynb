    "\n",
    "### Scaling numeric features\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalizing numeric features so they're on the same scale prevents features with large values from producing coefficients that disproportionately affect the predictions. For example, suppose your data includes the following numeric features:\n",
    "\n",
    "| A |  B  |  C  |\n",
    "| - | --- | --- |\n",
    "| 3 | 480 | 65  |\n",
    "    \n",
    "Normalizing these features to the same scale may result in the following values (assuming A contains values from 0 to 10, B contains values from 0 to 1000, and C contains values from 0 to 100):\n",
    "\n",
    "|  A  |  B  |  C  |\n",
    "| --  | --- | --- |\n",
    "| 0.3 | 0.48| 0.65|\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways you can scale numeric data, such as calculating the minimum and maximum values for each column and assigning a proportional value between 0 and 1, or by using the mean and standard deviation of a normally distributed variable to maintain the same *spread* of values on a different scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encoding categorical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models work best with numeric features rather than text values, so you generally need to convert categorical features into numeric representations.  For example, suppose your data includes the following categorical feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Size |\n",
    "| ---- |\n",
    "|  S   |\n",
    "|  M   |\n",
    "|  L   |\n",
    "\n",
    "You can apply *ordinal encoding* to substitute a unique integer value for each category, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Size |\n",
    "| ---- |\n",
    "|  0   |\n",
    "|  1   |\n",
    "|  2   |\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common technique is to use *one hot encoding* to create individual binary (0 or 1) features for each possible category value. For example, you could use one-hot encoding to translate the possible categories into binary columns like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "|  Size_S  |  Size_M  |  Size_L  |\n",
    "| -------  | -------- | -------- |\n",
    "|    1     |     0    |    0     |\n",
    "|    0     |     1    |    0     |\n",
    "|    0     |     0    |    1     |\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply these preprocessing transformations to the bike rental, we'll make use of a Scikit-Learn feature named *pipelines*. These enable us to define a set of preprocessing steps that end with an algorithm. You can then fit the entire pipeline to the data, so that the model encapsulates all of the preprocessing steps as well as the regression algorithm. This is useful, because when we want to use the model to predict values from new data, we need to apply the same transformations (based on the same statistical distributions and category encodings used with the training data).\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Note**: The term *pipeline* is used extensively in machine learning, often to mean very different things! In this context, we're using it to refer to pipeline objects in Scikit-Learn, but you may see it used elsewhere to mean something else."
