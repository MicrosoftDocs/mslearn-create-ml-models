    "In the last notebook we fit binary classifier to predict whether patients were diabetic or not. We used accuracy as a measure of how well the model performed, but accuracy isn't everything. In this notebook, we will look at alternatives to accuracy that can be much more useful in machine learning.\n",

    "Accuracy seems like a sensible metric to evaluate (and to a certain extent it is), but you need to be careful about drawing too many conclusions from the accuracy of a classifier. Remember that it's simply a measure of how many cases were predicted correctly. Suppose only 3% of the population is diabetic. You could create a classifier that always just predicts 0, and it would be 97% accurate - but not terribly helpful in identifying patients with diabetes!\n",
