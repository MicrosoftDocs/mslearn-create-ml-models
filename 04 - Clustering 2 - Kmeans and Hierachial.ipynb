    "\n",
    "1. A set of K centroids are randomly chosen.\n",
    "2. Clusters are formed by assigning the data points to their closest centroid.\n",
    "3. The means of each cluster is computed and the centroid is moved to the mean.\n",
    "4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until a stopping criteria is met. Typically, the algorithm terminates when each new iteration results in negligable movement of centroids and the clusters become static.\n",
    "5. When the clusters stop changing, the algorithm has *converged*, defining the locations of the clusters - note that the random starting point for the centroids means that re-running the algorithm could result in slightly different clusters, so training usually involves multiple iterations, reinitializing the centroids each time, and the model with the best WCSS is selected.\n",
